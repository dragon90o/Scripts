# üìä General Transfer Function Analysis in C++

A C++ implementation that allows you to compute the poles, zeros, magnitude in dB, and phase of a general transfer function. The code analyzes the transfer function, calculates its poles and zeros, evaluates its magnitude response (in dB), and computes the phase across specified angular frequencies.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project provides a modular approach to analyze transfer functions. Using mathematical techniques, it determines:

Poles and Zeros: Roots of the numerator and denominator polynomials.
Magnitude Response: Measured in decibels (dB) over a range of angular frequencies.
Phase Response: The phase angle (in degrees) across a range of angular frequencies.
This functionality is useful for analyzing control systems, signal processing applications, or frequency response characteristics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

‚úÖ Calculate poles and zeros of the transfer function from polynomial coefficients.
‚úÖ Evaluate magnitude in dB at specific angular frequencies.
‚úÖ Compute phase response in degrees at specified angular frequencies.
‚úÖ Supports the analysis of general transfer functions with user-provided numerator and denominator polynomials.
