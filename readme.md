<h2 align="center">## üöÄ Project Overview</h2>
<p align="center">

Prueva2.cpp is a C++ implementation that allows you to compute poles, zeros, magnitude in dB, and phase of a general transfer function. The user can also specify a custom sigma value (œÉ) to perform the desired adjustment to the transfer function's analysis.

This implementation uses Eigen for matrix manipulations and polynomial root-finding. Theuser can provide the numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function, specify angular frequency ranges, and optionally input a value for œÉ.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
‚úÖ Calculate the poles and zeros of the transfer function from polynomial coefficients, including the option to incorporate a custom sigma value if necessary.
‚úÖ Calculate the magnitude in dB at specified angular frequencies, with the option to include a custom sigma value if needed.
‚úÖ Compute phase response in degrees at specified angular frequencies.
‚úÖ Supports the analysis of general transfer functions with user-provided numerator and denominator polynomials.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies Required

This script relies on several external libraries:

Standard C++ Libraries:

These are part of the C++ standard and come with most compilers.
